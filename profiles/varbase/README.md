The powerful Drupal distribution for faster development, with editor experience
in mind. Brought to you by Vardot

Varbase is an enhanced Drupal distribution with a lot of necessities.
 Necessities are all the modules, features, configurations that we include
 in every project.

## It's made with the following benefits in mind:

* Speeds up development
* Offers standardized configuration and best-practices
* Comes with a lot of needed functionalities/modules for every-day Drupal site
* Tested, tested, and tested
* Varbase for Drupal 8

## Starting a new project? Consider Varbase for Drupal 8.

Installing Varbase 8.x-4.x comes with several extra automated installation
steps, to take full advantage of Varbase, other than the Drupal 8 installation
instructions.

## Install with Composer

```
composer create-project Vardot/varbase-build:^8.4.05 PROJECT_DIR_NAME --no-dev --no-interaction
```
